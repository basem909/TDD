# TDD
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)



> - Created a class called Solver
- Created a method called factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to N and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.
- Create a method called reverse that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed (e.g. if word is "hello" it returns "olleh").
- Create a method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string.
- start with tests for all of the methods described above. Your commit history should prove that you have used TDD.
